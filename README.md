# Design
#### Colour Scheme
There are two different types of grey used in the site. For the body I choose #777777 and for the font I choose #555555. I used these two grey's as I though they blended well with the colour of the car in the pictures.

#### Typography
For the main text of the website I used Lato and San-Serif fonts

For the site logo I used Oswald & Serif.

#### Imagery
All images used are my own photos. Link to my hosting sight: https://freeimage.host/a/valeting.JtjkX ###

# Testing #
## Index.html: ##
I began my testing starting with my index.html page. I began by testing the logo links, nav bar links and the social media links. I tested the web page was reponsive using Google Chromes Inspect tool. 
I ran my code through W3C validator. I got a warning "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elememts to add identifying headings to all sections." I google searched the the warning but was still unsure of a solution so I contacted Tutor support. The solution was I removed the section tag and replaced it with a div. I ran the code through the validator again and no warnings were spotted.

## Sevices.html ##
I began the testing of this page by checking the logo, navbar and social links were all working correctly. I then checked the site was responsive to different screen sizes. I ran my code through the vaidator and no errors or warnings appeared. 

## Gallery.html ##
 I started by checking the logo, navbar and social links brought me to the correct parts of the site. I then checked the site was responsive to different screen sizes. 
I ran my code through the HTML validator and got the same warning as my Index.html page (Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elememts to add identifying headings to all sections."). I solved this problem by replacing my section tag with a div tag. I ran the code again and no errors appeared. 

## Contact-Us.html ##
I began by testing the logo, navbar and social links were working correctly followed by checking the site was responsive to different screen sizes. 
I ran my code through the HTML validator 2 errors occured. The first error I found on the "Contact Number" section of the form. On the "label for" and "id" attributes I had put "contact-number" instead of "contactnumber". A quick Google search helped me solve this problem. The second error on my code was on the Email section. On my input type I had put "text" instead of "email". After correcting these errors I ran the code through the validator again and no warnings were spotted. 
I tested the form by leaving some of the required sections blank and trying to submit. It would not allow unless all sections were filled in.
